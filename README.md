## Description
This repository outlines the implementation of a LISTA network in Python using the PyTorch deep learning framework. The main purpose of this document is to shed light on implementing this network architecture to obtain sparse vectors through forward passes in a neural network.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* PyTorch = 1.6
* Numpy = 1.19
* Scikit-learn = 0.22
* Matplotlib = 3.3

### Installing
```
  git clone https://github.com/Aaatresh/LISTA
```


### Executing program

Running the program:
* Use Jupyter Notebook or google colab to open and run each cell of the notebook. Instructions in the notebook guide the user through training and testing the network.
```
jupyter notebook
```
